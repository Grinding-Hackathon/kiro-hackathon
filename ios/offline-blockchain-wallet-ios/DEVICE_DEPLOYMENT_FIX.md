# iOS Device Deployment Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the `QRCodeDetector.framework` not found error when deploying to physical iOS devices.

## Root Cause
The Xcode project was configured to use `QRCodeDetector` framework (which is part of the QRCode package but only needed for video detection), but this framework wasn't being properly embedded in the app bundle for device deployment.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed QRCodeDetector dependency** - The app only needs `QRCode` for static QR code generation, not `QRCodeDetector` for video detection
2. **Fixed project corruption** - Cleaned up malformed project file entries
3. **Cleaned build artifacts** - Removed cached build data that could cause issues

## Files Modified
- `offline-blockchain-wallet-ios.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Removed QRCodeDetector references
- Added fix scripts in `scripts/` directory

## Verification
The project now builds successfully for iOS devices. The only remaining step is code signing configuration.

## Next Steps for Device Deployment

### 1. Open Xcode
```bash
open offline-blockchain-wallet-ios.xcodeproj
```

### 2. Configure Code Signing
1. Select the project in Xcode navigator
2. Select the "offline-blockchain-wallet-ios" target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Select your development team
5. Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked

### 3. Select Your Device
1. Connect your iOS device via USB
2. Select your device from the device dropdown (next to the scheme selector)
3. Build and run (Cmd+R)

### 4. If You Still Have Issues
Run the verification script:
```bash
./scripts/verify_dependencies.sh
```

Or clean everything and rebuild:
```bash
./scripts/fix_device_deployment.sh
```

## Current Dependencies
The app now uses only these frameworks:
- ✅ **QRCode** - For QR code generation and display
- ✅ **CodeScanner** - For QR code scanning via camera
- ✅ **Alamofire** - For HTTP networking
- ✅ **web3swift** - For Ethereum blockchain interactions
- ✅ **KeychainAccess** - For secure key storage
- ✅ **CryptoSwift** - For cryptographic operations

## Removed Dependencies
- ❌ **QRCodeDetector** - Not needed for basic QR functionality
- ❌ **AlamofireDynamic** - Caused device deployment issues
- ❌ **QRCodeDynamic** - Caused device deployment issues

## Scripts Available
- `scripts/fix_project_corruption.sh` - Fix corrupted project files
- `scripts/fix_device_deployment.sh` - Complete device deployment fix
- `scripts/verify_dependencies.sh` - Check current dependencies
- `scripts/fix_xcode_project.sh` - Remove problematic framework references

## Troubleshooting

### If the app crashes on device launch:
1. Check that all frameworks are properly embedded
2. Verify code signing is correct
3. Check device logs in Xcode (Window → Devices and Simulators)

### If build fails:
1. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Reset package caches (File → Packages → Reset Package Caches)
3. Run `./scripts/fix_device_deployment.sh`

### If you see framework not found errors:
1. The fix should have resolved this
2. If it persists, run `./scripts/verify_dependencies.sh`
3. Check that you're not importing unused frameworks in your Swift code

## Success Indicators
✅ Project builds without QRCodeDetector errors  
✅ All package dependencies resolve correctly  
✅ No dynamic framework references in project  
✅ Clean project file structure  

The app should now deploy successfully to physical iOS devices!
