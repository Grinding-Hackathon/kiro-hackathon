# QR Scanner Flashlight Fix

## Issue
The camera was freezing when users tapped the flashlight button. This was caused by a conflict between CodeScanner's camera session and direct AVFoundation camera device access.

## Root Cause
The original implementation tried to control the flashlight by directly accessing `AVCaptureDevice` while CodeScanner was already managing the camera session. This created a resource conflict that caused the camera to freeze.

## Solution
Replaced direct AVFoundation flashlight control with CodeScanner's built-in torch functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CodeScannerView Configuration
```swift
CodeScannerView(
    codeTypes: [.qr],
    scanMode: .continuous,
    scanInterval: 1.0,
    showViewfinder: true,
    simulatedData: "",
    shouldVibrateOnSuccess: true,
    isTorchOn: torchIsOn,  // ‚Üê Added torch control
    completion: { result in
        // Handle results
    }
)
```

### 2. Simplified State Management
- Removed complex flashlight availability checking
- Replaced with simple `@State private var torchIsOn = false`
- Removed AVFoundation device locking/unlocking

### 3. Updated Toggle Function
```swift
private func toggleFlashlight() {
    torchIsOn.toggle()  // Simple state toggle
}
```

### 4. Cleaned Up ViewModel
- Removed flashlight-related properties and methods
- Kept only QR validation functionality
- Eliminated potential camera session conflicts

## Benefits

### Technical
- **No Camera Conflicts**: CodeScanner manages all camera operations
- **Simplified Code**: Removed complex AVFoundation device management
- **Better Performance**: No competing camera session access
- **Reliable Operation**: Torch control integrated with scanner lifecycle

### User Experience
- **No Freezing**: Camera remains responsive when toggling flashlight
- **Instant Response**: Torch toggles immediately without delays
- **Visual Feedback**: Flashlight icon updates correctly
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Torch turns off when view disappears

## Testing
- Flashlight toggle works without camera freezing
- Camera continues scanning after torch operations
- Proper cleanup when leaving scanner view
- Works on both physical devices and simulator (where supported)

## Technical Notes
- CodeScanner handles torch availability automatically
- No need for manual device capability checking
- Torch state is managed by SwiftUI state system
- Compatible with all CodeScanner features (vibration, viewfinder, etc.)
