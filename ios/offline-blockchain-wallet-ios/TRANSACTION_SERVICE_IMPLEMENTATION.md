# Transaction Service Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 15 "Implement transaction processing and validation" has been successfully completed. This implementation provides comprehensive transaction processing capabilities for the offline blockchain wallet, including transaction initiation, signing, verification, double-spending prevention, and queue management for offline-to-online synchronization.

## Implemented Components

### 1. TransactionService.swift

**Location**: `ios/offline-blockchain-wallet-ios/offline-blockchain-wallet-ios/Services/TransactionService.swift`

**Key Features**:
- **Transaction Initiation**: Create and validate new transactions with proper balance checks
- **Digital Signing**: Sign transactions using user private keys with cryptographic verification
- **Transaction Verification**: Multi-layer validation including signature verification and token ownership
- **Double-Spending Prevention**: Comprehensive checks to prevent token reuse and duplicate transactions
- **State Management**: Track active transactions and manage transaction lifecycle
- **Queue Management**: Handle offline-to-online synchronization with transaction queuing
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for failed or interrupted transactions
- **Async/Await Support**: Modern Swift concurrency for all operations

**Core Methods**:
- `initiateTransaction(recipientId:amount:type:)` - Create new transactions
- `signTransaction(_:with:)` - Sign transactions with private keys
- `verifyTransaction(_:)` - Comprehensive transaction validation
- `checkDoubleSpending(for:)` - Prevent double-spending attacks
- `updateTransactionState(_:to:)` - Manage transaction lifecycle
- `queueTransactionForSync(_:)` - Queue transactions for synchronization
- `processQueuedTransactions()` - Process pending sync transactions
- `handleFailedTransaction(_:error:)` - Handle transaction failures
- `retryFailedTransaction(_:)` - Retry failed transactions
- `cancelTransaction(_:)` - Cancel pending transactions

### 2. TransactionServiceTests.swift

**Location**: `ios/offline-blockchain-wallet-ios/Tests/OfflineBlockchainWalletTests/TransactionServiceTests.swift`

**Test Coverage**:
- Transaction initiation with various scenarios (success, invalid amount, insufficient balance)
- Transaction signing with cryptographic operations
- Transaction verification with signature validation
- Double-spending prevention with spent token detection
- Transaction state management and lifecycle
- Queue management for synchronization
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Publisher-based updates for reactive UI

### 3. Updated TransactionViewModel.swift

**Enhanced Features**:
- Integration with TransactionService
- Reactive updates using Combine publishers
- Transaction processing methods
- Queue management UI support
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 4. Updated Models

**Transaction.swift**:
- Made `metadata` property mutable for error handling
- Supports comprehensive transaction lifecycle management

## Architecture Highlights

### Thread-Safe State Management

The implementation uses a custom `TransactionState` actor to manage concurrent access to transaction data:

```swift
private actor TransactionState {
    private var activeTransactions: [String: Transaction] = [:]
    private var transactionQueue: [Transaction] = []
    
    func setActiveTransaction(_ transaction: Transaction) { ... }
    func removeActiveTransaction(id: String) { ... }
    func addToQueue(_ transaction: Transaction) { ... }
    func removeFromQueue(id: String) { ... }
}
```

### Reactive Updates

The service provides Combine publishers for real-time UI updates:

```swift
@Published var transactionUpdates = PassthroughSubject<Transaction, Never>()
@Published var queueUpdates = PassthroughSubject<[Transaction], Never>()
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling

Custom error types for specific transaction scenarios:

```swift
enum TransactionError: Error {
    case invalidAmount
    case invalidRecipient
    case insufficientBalance
    case walletNotInitialized
    case invalidTransaction
    case invalidSignature
    case doubleSpending
    case tokenNotOwned
    case transactionNotFound
    case processingFailed
    case syncFailed
}
```

## Security Features

### 1. Cryptographic Validation
- All transactions are cryptographically signed using user private keys
- Signature verification using public key cryptography
- Transaction integrity validation through hash verification

### 2. Double-Spending Prevention
- Token ownership verification before spending
- Spent token tracking to prevent reuse
- Duplicate transaction detection based on timing and participants

### 3. State Integrity
- Immutable transaction records once signed
- Atomic state updates to prevent corruption
- Comprehensive audit trail for all operations

## Integration Points

### 1. Storage Service Integration
- Persistent transaction storage using Core Data
- Efficient querying for transaction history
- Automatic cleanup of expired transactions

### 2. Cryptography Service Integration
- Secure key management using iOS Keychain
- Digital signature creation and verification
- Data encryption for sensitive transaction details

### 3. Offline Token Service Integration
- Balance validation before transaction creation
- Token selection for optimal change management
- Automatic token management and expiration handling
