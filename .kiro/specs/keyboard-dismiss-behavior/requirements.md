# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds keyboard dismissal functionality to the iOS offline blockchain wallet app. When users tap anywhere on the view outside of text input fields, the keyboard should automatically dismiss, providing a better user experience and following iOS design patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the keyboard to automatically dismiss when I tap outside of text input fields, so that I can easily hide the keyboard without having to manually dismiss it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on any area of the view that is not a text input field THEN the system SHALL dismiss the active keyboard
2. WHEN the keyboard is dismissed via tap gesture THEN the system SHALL maintain the current view state and user input data
3. WHEN multiple text fields are present on a view THEN the system SHALL dismiss the keyboard regardless of which field was previously active

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the keyboard dismissal to work consistently across all views in the app, so that I have a predictable and intuitive experience throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tap-to-dismiss functionality is implemented THEN the system SHALL apply it to all views containing text input fields
2. WHEN navigating between different views THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent keyboard dismissal behavior
3. WHEN the keyboard is visible on any view THEN the system SHALL respond to tap gestures for dismissal

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the keyboard dismissal to be smooth and responsive, so that the interaction feels natural and doesn't interfere with my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tap gesture is detected for keyboard dismissal THEN the system SHALL respond within 100 milliseconds
2. WHEN the keyboard is being dismissed THEN the system SHALL use smooth animation transitions
3. WHEN the keyboard dismissal animation is in progress THEN the system SHALL not interfere with other user interactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tap-to-dismiss behavior to not interfere with other interactive elements, so that I can still use buttons, links, and other controls normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on interactive elements like buttons or links THEN the system SHALL execute the element's action and not dismiss the keyboard
2. WHEN a user taps on scrollable content areas THEN the system SHALL allow scrolling while also dismissing the keyboard if active
3. WHEN a user taps on other text input fields THEN the system SHALL transfer focus to the new field without dismissing the keyboard
