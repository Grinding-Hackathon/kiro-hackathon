# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create keyboard dismissal view modifier and extension
  - Create `DismissKeyboardOnTap` view modifier that uses `onTapGesture` to trigger keyboard dismissal
  - Implement View extension with `dismissKeyboardOnTap()` method for easy application
  - Add proper UIKit integration using `UIApplication.shared.sendAction` for keyboard dismissal
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Apply keyboard dismissal to WalletView
  - Integrate the `dismissKeyboardOnTap()` modifier to the main WalletView
  - Test that keyboard dismisses when tapping outside text fields
  - Verify that existing button interactions still work correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [x] 3. Apply keyboard dismissal to TransactionView
  - Add the keyboard dismissal modifier to TransactionView
  - Test with transaction amount and description input fields
  - Ensure form validation and submission still work properly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Apply keyboard dismissal to SettingsView
  - Integrate keyboard dismissal functionality in SettingsView
  - Test with any configuration text inputs
  - Verify settings save functionality remains unaffected
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Apply keyboard dismissal to other views with text inputs
  - Identify and update any remaining views that contain text input fields
  - Apply the dismissal modifier consistently across all identified views
  - Test each view to ensure proper functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1_

- [x] 6. Handle gesture conflicts and edge cases
  - Test interaction with scrollable content areas to ensure both scrolling and keyboard dismissal work
  - Verify that tapping interactive elements (buttons, links) executes their actions without dismissing keyboard inappropriately
  - Handle rapid tap scenarios and ensure smooth performance
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 3.1_

- [x] 7. Add focus state management for enhanced UX
  - Implement `@FocusState` management for views with multiple text fields
  - Create focus field enumeration for better control
  - Test focus transitions between text fields work correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.3_

- [x] 8. Create unit tests for keyboard dismissal functionality
  - Write tests for the `DismissKeyboardOnTap` view modifier
  - Test that tap gestures trigger the correct keyboard dismissal action
  - Verify focus state changes work as expected
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 9. Create integration tests for cross-view consistency
  - Test keyboard dismissal behavior across all implemented views
  - Verify consistent behavior when navigating between views
  - Test with different device orientations and sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 10. Perform comprehensive testing and validation
  - Conduct manual testing on physical devices
  - Test accessibility compliance with VoiceOver
  - Verify performance and animation smoothness
  - Test with external keyboards if applicable
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
