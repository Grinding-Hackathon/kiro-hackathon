# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements a tap-to-dismiss keyboard functionality across all views in the iOS offline blockchain wallet app. The solution uses SwiftUI's built-in gesture recognition and keyboard management APIs to provide a consistent and smooth user experience.

## Architecture

The keyboard dismissal functionality will be implemented using a combination of:

1. **Tap Gesture Recognition**: Using SwiftUI's `onTapGesture` modifier
2. **Keyboard Management**: Leveraging `UIApplication.shared.sendAction` for keyboard dismissal
3. **View Extension**: Creating a reusable view modifier for consistent application
4. **Focus State Management**: Utilizing SwiftUI's `@FocusState` for better control

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Keyboard Dismissal View Modifier

```swift
struct DismissKeyboardOnTap: ViewModifier {
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .onTapGesture {
                UIApplication.shared.sendAction(#selector(UIResponder.resignFirstResponder), 
                                              to: nil, from: nil, for: nil)
            }
    }
}
```

### 2. View Extension

```swift
extension View {
    func dismissKeyboardOnTap() -> some View {
        self.modifier(DismissKeyboardOnTap())
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Focus Management

For views with multiple text fields, implement focus state management:

```swift
@FocusState private var focusedField: Field?

enum Field: Hashable {
    case field1, field2, field3
}
```

### 4. Integration Points

The modifier will be applied to:
- `WalletView.swift`
- `TransactionView.swift` 
- `SettingsView.swift`
- `QRScannerView.swift` (if it contains text inputs)
- Any other views with text input fields

## Data Models

No new data models are required. The implementation will work with existing view state and focus management.

## Error Handling

### Gesture Conflicts
- Ensure tap gestures don't interfere with existing button actions
- Use gesture priority and simultaneousGesture when needed
- Test with scrollable content to ensure proper behavior

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize gesture recognition overhead
- Ensure smooth animations during keyboard dismissal
- Handle rapid tap scenarios gracefully

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. Test that the view modifier correctly applies tap gesture
2. Verify keyboard dismissal action is triggered
3. Test focus state changes appropriately

### Integration Tests
1. Test keyboard dismissal across different views
2. Verify behavior with multiple text fields
3. Test interaction with other UI elements

### UI Tests
1. Automated tests for tap-to-dismiss functionality
2. Test keyboard animation smoothness
3. Verify accessibility compliance

### Manual Testing
1. Test on different device sizes and orientations
2. Verify behavior with external keyboards
3. Test with VoiceOver and other accessibility features

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
1. Create the `DismissKeyboardOnTap` view modifier
2. Add the View extension for easy application
3. Test basic functionality in isolation

### Phase 2: View Integration
1. Apply modifier to all relevant views
2. Handle any conflicts with existing gestures
3. Ensure consistent behavior across the app

### Phase 3: Enhancement and Polish
1. Add focus state management where beneficial
2. Optimize performance and animations
3. Add comprehensive testing

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Conduct thorough testing across all views
2. Verify accessibility compliance
3. Performance testing and optimization
