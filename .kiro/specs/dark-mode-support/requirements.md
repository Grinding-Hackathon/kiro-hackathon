# Dark Mode Support Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive dark mode support across the entire offline blockchain wallet iOS application. The implementation will provide users with a seamless dark mode experience that adapts to system preferences and offers manual override options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically adapt to my device's dark mode setting, so that the interface is consistent with my system preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is set to dark mode THEN the app SHALL automatically switch to dark mode
2. WHEN the device is set to light mode THEN the app SHALL automatically switch to light mode
3. WHEN the device switches between light and dark mode THEN the app SHALL transition smoothly without requiring a restart
4. WHEN the app launches THEN it SHALL respect the current system appearance setting

### Requirement 2: Manual Override

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually control the app's appearance mode, so that I can use my preferred theme regardless of system settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the settings THEN I SHALL see appearance options for "System", "Light", and "Dark"
2. WHEN I select "System" THEN the app SHALL follow the device's appearance setting
3. WHEN I select "Light" THEN the app SHALL use light mode regardless of system setting
4. WHEN I select "Dark" THEN the app SHALL use dark mode regardless of system setting
5. WHEN I change the appearance setting THEN the change SHALL take effect immediately

### Requirement 3: Color Scheme Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI elements to have appropriate colors in both light and dark modes, so that the interface is readable and visually appealing in all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in dark mode THEN all text SHALL be readable with sufficient contrast
2. WHEN in dark mode THEN all backgrounds SHALL use appropriate dark colors
3. WHEN in dark mode THEN all interactive elements SHALL be clearly distinguishable
4. WHEN in dark mode THEN brand colors SHALL maintain their identity while being dark-mode appropriate
5. WHEN switching modes THEN colors SHALL transition smoothly without jarring changes

### Requirement 4: Component Coverage

**User Story:** As a user, I want every screen and component in the app to support dark mode, so that I have a consistent experience throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the wallet screen THEN all elements SHALL display correctly in both light and dark modes
2. WHEN viewing the transaction screen THEN all elements SHALL display correctly in both light and dark modes
3. WHEN viewing the QR code screens THEN all elements SHALL display correctly in both light and dark modes
4. WHEN viewing the settings screen THEN all elements SHALL display correctly in both light and dark modes
5. WHEN viewing any modal or sheet THEN all elements SHALL display correctly in both light and dark modes
6. WHEN viewing any custom components THEN all elements SHALL display correctly in both light and dark modes

### Requirement 5: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with visual impairments, I want the dark mode implementation to maintain accessibility standards, so that I can use the app effectively regardless of the appearance mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in dark mode THEN all text SHALL meet WCAG contrast ratio requirements
2. WHEN in dark mode THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via VoiceOver
3. WHEN in dark mode THEN all visual indicators SHALL remain distinguishable
4. WHEN using high contrast accessibility settings THEN the app SHALL respect these preferences in both modes

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want dark mode transitions to be smooth and performant, so that switching between modes doesn't impact the app's responsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching appearance modes THEN the transition SHALL complete within 300ms
2. WHEN switching appearance modes THEN the app SHALL not experience frame drops
3. WHEN the app launches THEN appearance detection SHALL not delay the launch time
4. WHEN using the app THEN dark mode SHALL not impact battery life negatively

### Requirement 7: Asset Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want all images and icons to display appropriately in both light and dark modes, so that visual elements remain clear and purposeful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in dark mode THEN all icons SHALL use appropriate variants or colors
2. WHEN in dark mode THEN all images SHALL display with proper contrast
3. WHEN in dark mode THEN QR codes SHALL remain scannable with appropriate background colors
4. WHEN in dark mode THEN all visual assets SHALL maintain their intended meaning

### Requirement 8: State Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my appearance preference to be remembered across app launches, so that I don't need to reconfigure the setting each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set a manual appearance preference THEN it SHALL be saved persistently
2. WHEN I restart the app THEN my appearance preference SHALL be restored
3. WHEN I update the app THEN my appearance preference SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN I reinstall the app THEN the preference SHALL default to "System"
