# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a blockchain-based mobile wallet system that enables secure offline transactions through Bluetooth connectivity. The system is designed to serve users in rural areas with limited or unstable internet connections by allowing them to purchase Offline Tokens (OTs) while online, conduct transactions offline via Bluetooth, and later redeem these tokens when connectivity is restored. The system leverages cryptographic signatures, token divisibility, and a centralized Offline Token Manager (OTM) to ensure transaction security and integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user in a rural area, I want to purchase Offline Tokens while I have internet connectivity, so that I can conduct transactions even when offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has internet connectivity THEN the system SHALL allow them to request Offline Tokens from the OTM
2. WHEN the OTM receives a valid OT request THEN it SHALL return a cryptographically signed transaction using its private key
3. WHEN an OT is generated THEN the system SHALL store it locally on the user's device as a single transaction to prevent tampering
4. IF a user attempts to purchase OTs without sufficient balance THEN the system SHALL reject the request and display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN OTs are successfully purchased THEN the system SHALL update the user's local OT balance immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user, I want the system to automatically manage my Offline Token purchases and handle expiration, so that I always have valid tokens available without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables automatic OT purchasing THEN the system SHALL monitor their OT balance and purchase new tokens when balance falls below a threshold
2. WHEN OTs approach their expiration time THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to purchase replacement tokens
3. IF automatic OT purchase fails due to insufficient funds THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide options to add funds
4. WHEN OTs expire before being used THEN the system SHALL automatically restore the user's money to their blockchain balance
5. WHEN expired OTs are detected THEN the system SHALL remove them from local storage and update the balance display
6. IF the user is offline when OTs expire THEN the system SHALL queue the restoration process for when connectivity returns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user, I want to generate and scan QR codes for easy transaction initiation, so that I can quickly share payment information and establish connections with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a payment request THEN the system SHALL generate a QR code containing transaction details and Bluetooth connection information
2. WHEN scanning a QR code THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the transaction information and connection details
3. IF a QR code contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a valid QR code is scanned THEN the system SHALL pre-populate transaction fields and initiate Bluetooth pairing
5. WHEN generating QR codes THEN the system SHALL include necessary cryptographic verification data and device pairing information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user, I want to establish secure Bluetooth connections with other users after QR code scanning, so that I can safely conduct peer-to-peer offline transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a QR code is successfully scanned THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate Bluetooth connection to the specified device
2. WHEN establishing a Bluetooth connection THEN the system SHALL create a secure Personal Area Network (PAN)
3. WHEN connecting to another wallet THEN the system SHALL verify the other device is running compatible wallet software
4. IF Bluetooth pairing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
5. WHEN a secure connection is established THEN the system SHALL enable OT transfer functionality
6. WHEN the connection is terminated THEN the system SHALL ensure all pending transactions are properly handled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user, I want to send Offline Tokens to another user via Bluetooth when internet is unavailable, so that I can complete transactions in offline environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a receiver requests OTs from a sender via Bluetooth THEN the sender SHALL be able to transmit the previously signed OT transaction
2. WHEN the receiver receives an OT transaction THEN the system SHALL verify the transaction using the OTM's public key
3. IF the OT transaction signature is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction and notify both parties
4. WHEN a valid OT transaction is received THEN the system SHALL store it locally on the receiver's device
5. WHEN Bluetooth connectivity is lost during transmission THEN the system SHALL handle the interruption gracefully and allow retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user, I want to divide Offline Tokens to make exact payments and receive change, so that I can conduct precise transactions without overpaying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a receiver determines the exact amount needed THEN they SHALL be able to send a pull-token request specifying the amount
2. WHEN a sender receives a pull-token request THEN the system SHALL prepare token division for the requested amount
3. WHEN tokens are divided THEN the system SHALL maintain cryptographic integrity of both the payment and change portions
4. IF the sender has insufficient OT balance for the requested amount THEN the system SHALL reject the division request
5. WHEN token division is complete THEN both sender and receiver SHALL have appropriately signed transaction records

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user, I want to exchange divided Offline Tokens securely with another user, so that the transaction is authenticated and cannot be forged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sender and receiver exchange signed transactions THEN the sender SHALL sign the transfer using their private key
2. WHEN the receiver gets the signed transfer THEN they SHALL verify and decrypt it using their private key
3. IF signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL reject the transaction and notify both parties
4. WHEN a transaction is successfully verified THEN the system SHALL update local balances for both parties
5. WHEN the transaction is complete THEN both parties SHALL have immutable transaction records stored locally

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user who has received Offline Tokens, I want to convert them to real coins when I'm back online, so that I can access the actual blockchain value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with received OTs regains internet connectivity THEN they SHALL be able to send transactions to the OTM
2. WHEN the OTM receives OT redemption requests THEN it SHALL validate all cryptographic signatures
3. IF OT signatures are valid THEN the system SHALL convert OTs to real coins on the blockchain
4. WHEN OTs are successfully redeemed THEN the system SHALL update the user's blockchain balance
5. IF OT redemption fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information to the user

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user, I want the system to prevent double-spending and token forgery, so that my transactions are secure and cannot be manipulated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OT is spent THEN the system SHALL mark it as used to prevent double-spending
2. WHEN validating transactions THEN the system SHALL verify all cryptographic signatures against known public keys
3. IF a forged or tampered transaction is detected THEN the system SHALL reject it and log the security event
4. WHEN storing transactions locally THEN the system SHALL use tamper-evident storage mechanisms
5. WHEN syncing with the blockchain THEN the system SHALL validate that all OT redemptions correspond to legitimate purchases

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a mobile wallet user, I want to view my current balances and transaction history, so that I can track my offline and online token holdings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the wallet application THEN the system SHALL display current OT balance and blockchain balance separately
2. WHEN a user views transaction history THEN the system SHALL show both completed and pending transactions
3. WHEN displaying transactions THEN the system SHALL indicate whether transactions were conducted online or offline
4. IF transaction data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warnings to the user
5. WHEN balances are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the display in real-time

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of all transactions, so that I can ensure system integrity and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any transaction occurs THEN the system SHALL log all relevant details including timestamps and signatures
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information for debugging
3. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for review
4. WHEN users sync with the blockchain THEN the system SHALL log synchronization events
5. WHEN accessing logs THEN authorized personnel SHALL be able to query and analyze transaction patterns

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of all transactions, so that I can ensure system integrity and troubleshoot issues.
