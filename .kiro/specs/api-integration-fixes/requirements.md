# API Integration Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical gaps and mismatches between the iOS mobile application and the backend API implementation. The analysis revealed several missing API endpoints, incomplete implementations, and response format inconsistencies that prevent proper integration between the mobile app and backend services.

The primary goal is to ensure complete API compatibility, enabling seamless communication between the iOS application and backend services for all wallet operations, transaction management, and token handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Transaction Management API

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want all transaction operations to work seamlessly between the iOS app and backend, so that I can submit, sync, and track transactions reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a transaction through the iOS app THEN the backend SHALL process and store the transaction with proper validation
2. WHEN a user requests transaction synchronization THEN the backend SHALL return all transactions since the specified timestamp in the expected format
3. WHEN a user checks transaction status THEN the backend SHALL return accurate status information with proper error handling
4. WHEN offline transactions need synchronization THEN the backend SHALL handle offline transaction data and update blockchain state accordingly
5. IF a transaction submission fails THEN the backend SHALL return detailed error information that the iOS app can handle appropriately

### Requirement 2: Token Management API Completion

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want token validation and division operations to work correctly, so that I can use offline tokens for transactions with proper change management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user validates a token THEN the backend SHALL verify token signature, expiration, and ownership status
2. WHEN a user divides a token for change THEN the backend SHALL create new tokens with proper signatures and update the original token
3. WHEN token validation fails THEN the backend SHALL return specific validation failure reasons
4. WHEN public keys are requested THEN the backend SHALL return the complete PublicKeyDatabase structure expected by iOS
5. IF token operations encounter errors THEN the backend SHALL provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 3: Wallet Balance API Enhancement

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want wallet balance queries to work for both general and specific wallet lookups, so that I can check balances accurately across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their wallet balance THEN the backend SHALL return blockchain and offline token balances in the expected format
2. WHEN a specific wallet ID balance is requested THEN the backend SHALL return balance information for that wallet
3. WHEN balance information is unavailable THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN balance data is returned THEN it SHALL include all fields expected by the iOS application
5. IF wallet balance queries fail THEN the backend SHALL provide clear error messaging

### Requirement 4: Response Format Standardization

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want consistent response formats between iOS expectations and backend responses, so that the app can parse and handle API responses correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token purchase responses are returned THEN they SHALL match the TokenPurchaseResponse structure expected by iOS
2. WHEN token redemption responses are returned THEN they SHALL match the TokenRedemptionResponse structure expected by iOS
3. WHEN transaction sync responses are returned THEN they SHALL include lastSyncTimestamp and transaction arrays as expected
4. WHEN public key responses are returned THEN they SHALL match the PublicKeyDatabase structure with nested publicKeys object
5. IF response structures change THEN both iOS and backend SHALL be updated consistently

### Requirement 5: Error Handling Consistency

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want consistent error handling across all API operations, so that I receive clear feedback when operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the backend SHALL return standardized error responses with success: false
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the backend SHALL return detailed field-level error information
3. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the iOS app SHALL handle them gracefully with retry mechanisms
5. IF critical errors occur THEN proper logging SHALL be implemented on both client and server sides

### Requirement 6: Security Integration Enhancement

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want the iOS app to integrate with backend security features, so that I can benefit from fraud detection, health monitoring, and backup management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security health checks are available THEN the iOS app SHALL be able to query system health status
2. WHEN fraud alerts are generated THEN the iOS app SHALL be able to retrieve and display relevant alerts
3. WHEN backup operations are needed THEN the iOS app SHALL be able to trigger and monitor backup processes
4. WHEN security metrics are available THEN the iOS app SHALL be able to access security dashboard information
5. IF security issues are detected THEN the iOS app SHALL receive appropriate notifications and guidance

### Requirement 7: Authentication Flow Completion

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want the authentication system to work seamlessly with proper token refresh and logout functionality, so that I can maintain secure access to my wallet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the iOS app SHALL automatically refresh tokens using the refresh endpoint
2. WHEN users log out THEN the backend SHALL properly invalidate tokens and clear session data
3. WHEN nonce requests are made THEN the backend SHALL provide cryptographically secure nonces for wallet signing
4. WHEN signature validation occurs THEN the backend SHALL properly verify wallet signatures against provided messages
5. IF authentication fails THEN users SHALL receive clear feedback about the failure reason

### Requirement 8: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want API operations to be fast and reliable, so that I can use the wallet efficiently without delays or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN response times SHALL be under 2 seconds for normal operations
2. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the iOS app SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. WHEN offline operations are queued THEN they SHALL be processed reliably when connectivity is restored
4. WHEN concurrent requests occur THEN the backend SHALL handle them without data corruption or race conditions
5. IF performance degrades THEN monitoring systems SHALL detect and alert on performance issues

### Requirement 9: Data Consistency and Integrity

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want data to remain consistent between the iOS app and backend, so that my wallet state is always accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions are processed THEN wallet balances SHALL be updated consistently across all systems
2. WHEN tokens are spent THEN they SHALL be marked as spent in both local storage and backend database
3. WHEN synchronization occurs THEN data conflicts SHALL be resolved using proper conflict resolution strategies
4. WHEN data validation fails THEN operations SHALL be rolled back to maintain consistency
5. IF data corruption is detected THEN recovery mechanisms SHALL restore data to a consistent state

### Requirement 10: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive testing coverage for all API integrations, so that we can ensure reliability and catch issues before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are implemented THEN they SHALL have corresponding unit tests with >90% coverage
2. WHEN integration testing is performed THEN all iOS-backend communication paths SHALL be tested
3. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN all error handling paths SHALL be validated
4. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN API endpoints SHALL meet performance requirements under load
5. IF tests fail THEN the issues SHALL be resolved before deployment to production
